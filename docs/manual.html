                    Assembus is a 3D environment supporting the initial model assembly phase.
                    It provides functionality to explicitly specify the component assembly sequence.
                    Multiple assembly stations can be created to map the real-world situation at the factory inside
                    Assembus.
                    Components can be ordered and grouped to component groups.
                    Assembus allows the user to partially or fully assemble and disassemble the model in a 3D preview in
                    realtime
                    to understand the construction process and to optimize the assembly process.
                    Additionally, the assembly line configuration can be exported for other applications.

        </div>
        <p>
            After opening the application you see the project creation window. At the right-hand side, you can create a
            new project by entering your preferred project name, a destination where it should be saved, and the
            .obj-file of your assembled 3D model. Optionally, you can overwrite an existing project at the destination
            directory. Your project is created after clicking on the "Create"-button.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the left half of the window you can see previously created projects. You can open them by simply clicking
            on the project or delete it by clicking on the trashcan icon. Further, you are able to open projects which
            are not listed with the "Import"-button.

        <p>
            After opening Assembus you are greeted by the hierarchical component listing and the 3D preview of the
            imported model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 3D preview visualizes all components of the assembled model. You can easily inspect the 3D model by
            using your mouse.
            To rotate the object, hold the right mouse button while moving the mouse. The mousewheel can be used to zoom
            in and out. Additionally, you can change the focus of the camera by double clicking a component of the 3D
            model or an entry of the hierarchical list.
        </p>

        <div class="manual-image-container">
            <img alt="Highlighting" data-action="zoom" src="img/manual/highlighting.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            To identify an element of the hierarchical list in the preview, simply click on it. This works in both
            directions - clicking on a component of the 3D model will highlight the corresponding entry in the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to revert any changes you go a step back in the history by clicking the Undo-button in the
            sidebar navigation. Similarly, you can move one step forward with the Redo-button. Alternatively, both
            action are mapped to a shortcut:
            <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> to Undo and
            <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> to Redo.

        </div>

        <p>
            The editing of your assembly sequence is done in the hierarchical list. The actual assembly sequence is
            defined by the ordering of the elements inside the hierarchical list.
            The ordering can be modified by dragging elements. Multiple items can be selected by clicking and
            holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while selecting items in the list. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select all items
            between two boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, all components are located inside the "Default Station". New assembly stations can be created by
            clicking the overflow-menu in the top and selecting "Create Station". The station will be added as a
            top-level group.
            Simply move components into the new station by using Drag&Drop.
            The separation into station is used by the <a href=#station-view>Station View</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep the project clean and tidy, multiple components can be grouped into groups.
            You can either right-click on an assembly station and select "Add Group" to create a new empty group or you
            can select multiple items to be grouped and right click on the selection and select "Group selected" to
            group
            the marked components.
            If you want to abstract pre-built components, you can fuse existing groups by right-clicking on a group and
            selecting "Fuse Group" to hide all items of the group from the user. Fused groups are marked with a chain
            icon
            and their content can be toggled by clicking at the icon.
        </p>
        <p>
            To rename a component, component group or assembly station, open the context menu with a right-click and
            select "Rename" to alter the displayed name.

        <p>
            The StationView allows to fully assemble and disassemble the 3D model in realtime.
            It allows you to visualize and understand your built assembly line through the help
            of the 3D preview. You can use the default mouse navigation to view the 3D model.
        </p>

        <p>
            The StationView allows you to assemble all parts which are part of a specific assembly station.
            To open the StationView for a specific assembly station, simply click on the box-pointer-icon
            of the corresponding station in the list.
        </p>


        <p>
            Use the skip-arrows on the bottom of the screen to incrementally assemble or disassemble all components.
            The dot-icon and the color highlighting in the hierarchical list indicates which components have already
            been assembled into the final model. <br/>
            Alternatively you can right-click on a list item and select "Skip To" to jump to the selected component.

            To switch the currently visible station, simply click on the navigation arrows on the top of the screen.
            The name of the currently visible station is displayed on the top of the screen.
        </p>


        <p>
            By default, all components which have been assembled in previous stations, are hidden to ensure clarity.
            You can enable visibility of components from preceding stations by clicking the eye-button in the upper
            right
            corner of the screen.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            The CinemaMode offers a movie-like experience to visualize the assembly process and to train assembly
            personnel.
            This mode works similar to the StationView but is is not indented to apply changes to the assembly line but
            to solely
            playback the entire assembly process for employee training.
        </p>

        <p>
            To open the CinemaMode, simply click on the box-triangle icon on the sidebar. The CinemaMode screen will
            appear and start with
            the very first assembly station. To start playback, click the triangle button. To stop playback, click on
            the playback button again.
            You can skip to the previous or next component with the skip buttons. The assembly speed/delay can be
            modified with the speed slider right next
            to the playback control buttons. Move the slider left to the center to disassemble the model, move the
            slider to the right of the slider center to
            assemble the vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively you can click and drag around the dot indicator which is placed on the progress bar, which is
            located above the playback controls to go one step back
            or forth. Each section of the progress bar represents one assembly station. The dot indicator shows the
            assembly progress inside the current station. To show the
            name of the assembly station and the amount of components, simply hover the mouse above the desired progress
            bar section.

<section id="export">

        <h1>Export</h1>

        <p>
            The export function allows you to easily export your entire assembly line configuration, which includes all
            defined assembly stations, component ordering
            and (fused) component groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Assembus exports your assembly line configuration as a simple ZIP file which uses the .bus file-ending. The
            ZIP directory contains the actual 3D OBJ file
            and the assembly line configuration which uses the XML meta language to describe the assembly sequence.
        </p>

        <p>
            To invoke the export, simply click on the box icon with the upwards arrow, which is located in the sidebar.
            Specify a export directory and the desired
            export filename. Finally click the save button to export the Assembus project.
