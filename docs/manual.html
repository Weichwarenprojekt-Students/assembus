            Assembus is a 3D environment supporting the initial model assembly phase.
            It provides functionality to explicitly specify the component assembly sequence.
            Multiple assembly stations can be created to map the real-world situation at the factory inside Assembus.
            Components can be ordered and grouped to component groups.
            Assembus allows the user to partially or fully assemble and disassemble the model in a 3D preview in realtime
            to understand the construction process and to optimize the assembly process.
            Additionally, the assembly line configuration can be exported for other applications.

        <p>
            After opening the application you see the project creation window. At the right-hand side, you can create a
            new project by entering your preferred project name, a destination where it should be saved, and the
            .obj-file of your assembled 3D model. Optionally, you can overwrite an existing project at the destination
            directory. Your project is created after clicking on the "Create"-button.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the left half of the window you can see previously created projects. You can open them by simply clicking
            on the project or delete it by clicking on the trashcan icon. Further, you are able to open projects which
            are not listed with the "Import"-button.

            After opening Assembus you are greeted by the hierarchical component listing and the 3D preview of the
            imported model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 3D preview visualizes all components of the assembled model. You can easily inspect the 3D model by
            using your mouse.
            To rotate the object, hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse. The mousewheel can be used to zoom
            in and out. Additionally, you can change the focus of the camera by double clicking a component of the 3D
            model or an entry of the hierarchical list.
            To identify an element of the hierarchical list in the preview, simply click on it. This works in both
            directions - clicking on a component of the 3D model will highlight the corresponding entry in the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to revert any changes you go a step back in the history by clicking the Undo-button in the
            sidebar navigation. Similarly, you can move one step forward with the Redo-button. Alternatively, both
            action are mapped to a shortcut:
            <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> to Undo and
            <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd> to Redo.

        <h1>Editing the Assembly Line</h1>
        <p>
            The editing of your assembly sequence is done in the hierarchical list. The actual assembly sequence is defined
            by the ordering of the elements inside the hierarchical list.
            The ordering can be modified by dragging elements. Multiple items can be selected by clicking and
            holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while selecting items in the list. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> to select all items between two boundaries.

            By default, all components are located inside the "Default Station". New assembly stations can be created by clicking the overflow-menu
            in the top and selecting "Create Station". Simply move components into the new station by using Drag&Drop.

            To keep the project clean and tidy, multiple components can be grouped into groups.
            You can either right-click on an assembly station and select "Add Group" to create a new empty group or you can
            select multiple items to be grouped and right click on the selection and select "Group selected" to group the marked components.
            If you want to abstract pre-built components, you can fuse existing groups by right-clicking on a group and selecting "Fuse Group" to
            hide all items of the group from the user. Fused groups are marked with a chain icon and their content can be shown by
            Top-level groups represent stations of the assembly line. <a href=#station-view>Station View</a>

            To rename a component, component group or assembly station, open the context menu with a right-click and select "Rename" to alter the displayed name.
